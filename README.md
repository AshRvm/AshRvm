I'm Aswin Ramesh, an undergrad in the CS department at IIT Madras. I'm that kind of guy who likes to learn things in his own pace, but wouldn't mind some pushes every now and then.

Things I'm interested in include:
- Japanese culture
- Gaming
- Competitive Programming 

The things I'm looking into as of July, 2021 include:
- Web dev 
- Machine Learning 

As far as life achievements go, haven't done much so far, but I do plan on changing that soon enough :)
